# Portal Lesson README

## Overview

This project is the result of completing the Portal Lesson in Bruno Simons' Three.js course. The goal was to create a captivating portal effect using Blender for modeling and Three.js with GLSL for rendering.

## Technologies Used

- **Blender**: Used for modeling the scene, including the portal geometry.
- **Three.js**: Utilized for creating the 3D scene and rendering.
- **GLSL**: Employed for writing shaders to achieve the portal effect.

## How to Use

1. **Modeling**: Create the scene and portal geometry in Blender.
2. **Export**: Export the model from Blender in a compatible format.
3. **Setup**: Set up a Three.js scene and import the model.
4. **Shaders**: Write GLSL shaders for the portal effect.
5. **Interaction**: Implement user interaction controls.
6. **Testing**: Test the project across different devices and browsers.
7. **Deployment**: Deploy the project to a web server for sharing.

## Conclusion

Completing this lesson has provided valuable experience in creating immersive 3D effects. Experimenting with shaders and interaction techniques has enhanced understanding and skills in Three.js and GLSL. Further customization and exploration are encouraged to expand upon this project.
